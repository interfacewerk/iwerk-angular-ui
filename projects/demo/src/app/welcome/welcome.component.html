<h1>Interfacewerk Angular UI</h1>

<h2><i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Production ready, highly customizable</h2>
<p>This library is a set of interface tools that we use everyday in our Angular projects. They are designed as single blocks, easily customizable with CSS, opinionated
  components or directives.
</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> AOT compatible</h2>
<p>We keep this library up-to-date with the latest Angular capabilities. Therefore, we can use any of its component in your AOT ready projects.</p>

<h2><i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> UX and performance</h2>
<p>We develop this library with the user experience in mind. Therefore, interactions must be easy to understand and none of the components should affect
  the performance. When working with other libraries, we often face the problem that, in huge tables, a simple tooltip on each cell could greatly impact
  the snappiness of the application.
